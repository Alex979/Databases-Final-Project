<h1>Roles:  </h1>	
<p>Ben:
course catalog, form 1, apply to graduate, transcript (part), GPA calculation, view form 1, ads schema sql </p>
<p>Brooke: 
transcript (part), logout, permissions, view student personal info, success/error pages, populate tables sql </p>
<p>Tuhina:
login, css/navigation, view everything for systems admin, edit personal info, home pages for all the users, reset sql </p>

<h1>Assumptions:  </h1>	
<p>We were unsure about the distinction between the Form 1 and Apply to Graduate form so we choose to implement Form 1 as a 4 year plan
and Apply to Graduate as an audit of the courses the student actually took against the courses in their plan (taken table against form 1 table).
For the sys admin user, we interpretted "has access to everything" to mean that they could switch roles. To do this they can access the login
information for different types of users in the database using the dropdown menu. We were unsure about what course ECE 6244 was as
we couldn't find it in the ads document on blackboard so we assumed it was another ECE course instead.
